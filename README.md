ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 – Advanced Data Analysis (Python)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs an advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 dataset using Python.
The goal is to analyze team performance, batting efficiency, bowling effectiveness, and venue patterns using meaningful statistical techniques and advanced visualizations (beyond basic bar charts).

📂 Dataset Used

The dataset is sourced from a public Google Drive folder and includes multiple CSV files such as:

matches.csv – Match-level details

batting.csv – Player batting performance

bowling.csv – Player bowling performance

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab

🔄 Step-by-Step Process
1️⃣ Data Import

Downloaded the dataset from a public Google Drive link

Loaded CSV files using Pandas

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing values only in critical columns

Ensured consistency in team, venue, and performance fields

3️⃣ Data Analysis

Team-wise performance analysis

Batting order efficiency analysis

Bowling dominance and wicket-taking ability

Venue-wise match distribution

4️⃣ Data Visualization

Instead of relying only on bar charts, advanced visualization techniques were used for deeper insights.

📊 Advanced Visualizations Used
🔹 Boxplot

Runs Distribution by Batting Order Group

Groups: Top Order, Middle Order, Lower Order

Helps understand consistency and spread of runs

🔹 Line Chart

Cumulative Runs Scored by Teams Over the Tournament

Shows performance trends across matches

Highlights consistency of top teams

🔹 Heatmap

Team vs Venue – Matches Played

Visualizes team presence across venues

Helps identify venue-based exposure

🔹 Scatter Plot

Bowling Economy vs Wickets Taken

Analyzes efficiency vs aggression

Identifies effective bowling teams

🔍 Key Insights

Top-order batters contribute the most consistent runs

Strong teams show steady cumulative performance throughout the tournament

Certain venues hosted more matches and influenced team exposure

Teams with lower economy and higher wickets were more dominant

Advanced plots reveal insights that bar charts alone cannot show

🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how advanced yet simple Python analysis can uncover meaningful insights from sports data.
By using appropriate statistical grouping and visualization techniques, the analysis provides a clear story of team and player performance during ICC World Cup 2023.

▶️ How to Run the Project
